## Zotero
this includes only notes on how to setup Zotero to do certain things, such as how to setup the proxy for Notre Dame for ease of downloading from paywalled sites, and how to setup Zotero backup using Zotero drive and box.com WebDAV for easy backups of references and files without encountering a limit too soon.

### Styling
To style the GUI interface of Zotero, e.g. dark theme, use GTK-3 themes.
